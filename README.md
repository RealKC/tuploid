# Tuploid

Have you ever looked at your favourite mainstream language and thought to
yourself "Man, I sure wish it didn't have this class, struct and/or array
bloat"? ... No? ... Just me? Ok then..., just pretend you did.

Enter Tuploid: a tuple-oriented language. With Tuploid we have come to a realisation: arrays, structs, even classses are just tuples, so we aim to provide tuples as your main means of abstraction.
